<h2 id="privatization">Privatization<a class="headerlink" href="#privatization" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The movement of assets, services or management of either from the
    public to the private sector. MBA programs at McGill, Russel Group,
    state universities in the US.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="corporatization">Corporatization<a class="headerlink" href="#corporatization" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Reorganizing structures of a public company to allow adoption of
    private sector management systems.</li>
<li>Structure and growing power of the Board of Governors.</li>
<li>Increased management salaries at the expense of workers wages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outsourcing-contracting-out">Outsourcing &amp; contracting-out<a class="headerlink" href="#outsourcing-contracting-out" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Outsourcing: non-core services purchased from outside companies.</li>
<li>Contracting-out: replacing work that used to be done within the
    company with a contracted supplier outside the company that is owned
    or controlled by the purchaser.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an university setting, outsourcing would be where custodial services
are contracted to an outside company. Contracting-out would happen when
the services are centralized and have to be purchased from that central,
university owned and managed service. IT services, repair services,
teaching services can all be contracted-out from department level to
centralized university services.</p>
<p>Contracting-out is usually the first step towards outsourcing.</p>
<h2 id="commodification">Commodification<a class="headerlink" href="#commodification" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The restructuring a public good into a commodity. Service or access
    to assets become commodified when a price is applied to a previously
    free or socialized good or service.</li>
<li>For PSE, raising tuition fees and breaking-out other fees as
    "ancillary" commodifies education. As tuition fees go up and start
    to represent the "actual" cost of education there is more of a
    business relationship between the university services and
    the student.</li>
<li>The result is a change in the nature of an education, less merit
    based education. For example, the professor cannot fail someone in a
    fully commodified education system since they have purchased
    the degree.</li>
<li>The impact on non-academic services is that all services become
    viewed through a commodity lens and this makes it easier to
    privatize services. There is a loss of solidarity between the
    students and the workers as students become consumers (owners)
    instead of just accessing a service.</li>
<li>Also occurs at the course/discipline level. Whenever you hear about
    the "arts" being under-valued, that is a form of commodification
    of education.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marketization">Marketization<a class="headerlink" href="#marketization" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deregulation of prices elimination of public subsidies withing a
    public system with the explicit intent on allowing free market
    principles to set price and access. This can still happen when there
    are publicly owned companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketization of education is occurring in the UK with the
    establishment of a constructed competitive market for courses
    between the universities and the deregulation of tuition fees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ivy-league schools in the US are along this model</p>
<h2 id="commercialization">Commercialization<a class="headerlink" href="#commercialization" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The commercialisation of university research refers to the
    conversion of new knowledge into "intellectual property" which is
    then transferred from universities to the marketplace.</li>
<li>Started in 1996 with the first Federal Liberal government's Expert
    Panel on the Commercialization of University Research.</li>
<li>The report outlined that, in order for research to be beneficial to
    Canadians, it ought to generate economic wealth or strategic
    advantage to Canadian corporations.</li>
<li>Federal commercialisation initiatives create incentives for
    universities to meet the needs of business rather than broader
    social objectives upon which universities were founded. Universities
    are becoming less independent, less trustworthy, and less reliable
    as they become more involved in business ventures. Universities are
    also at risk of becoming less inclined towards protecting public
    interest over private interests as the financial costs of losing
    industry partners becomes greater.</li>
<li>Disrupts the nature of the university.</li>
<li>Makes research secret.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financialization">Financialization<a class="headerlink" href="#financialization" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing the influence of finance capital, financial markets and
    financial services in the management of a service or market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endowments, technology transfer offices.</p>
</li>
