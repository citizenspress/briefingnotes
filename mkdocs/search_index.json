The original GEA was supposed to foster\ninvestment in the Ontario production of wind and solar generators and\ntechnology that reduces energy demand such as LED light bulbs for\ntraffic lights. The focus of the plan was to subsidize the growth in the\npercentage of and absolute amount of generation using solar/wind/biomass\nin Ontario's supply mix.\n\n\nInstead of supporting the growth of public electricity generation, the\nOntario government's plan for electricity generation through solar, wind\nand biomass growth was to use feed-in tariffs and other subsidies to\ndrive private investment.\n\n\nThe original Green Energy Act had a requirement that a percentage of all\nrenewable products had to be manufactured in Ontario to get access to\nthe public subsidy. However, this was challenged at the WTO, Ontario\nlost and had to remove this local procurement provision from the Act.\n\n\nThe government has also spurred investment of wind/solar/biomass\ngeneration through \"The Large Renewable Procurement\" (LRP), a\ncompetitive process for procuring large renewable energy projects\ngenerally larger than 500 kilowatts. This procurement process used\nsubsidies, long-term price guarantees and direct financial support to\ndrive private investment.\n\n\nOntario now has about 4,000 MW of installed wind capacity and 2,000 of\nsolar power capacity.\n\n\nOne of these larger wind procurement deals was the 20-year power\npurchase agreement with Samsung which includes 140 turbines. In 2013,\nthe government cut the original project by \\$3.4B in 2013 leading to\nquestions about the stability of the Ontario government's green energy\nsubsidy programs. The project was completed in May 2015. In 2016,\nSamsung sold its stake the 270-megawatt project to Axium Infrastructure,\nAlberta Teachers' Retirement Fund and Manulife Financial Corp.\n\n\nOn September 27, the Ontario government cancelled it latest LRP. This\nround of LRP was for about 1GW of \"planned\" growth in solar, biomass and\nwind generation. This will not affect the growth of new private smaller\nscale developments that have access to public subsidies through the\nfee-in-tariffs (FIT) system. FIT is designed to support projects up to\n500 kilowatts with a subsidy for electricity provided back to the grid.\nThe cancellation happened after the period for open submissions the\nprocurement process ended, leading to the private sector denouncing the\ncancellation and the government for wasting their time and money.\n\n\nAnalysis\n ~\n\n\nThe cancellation of 1GW of new private renewable generation is small\nwhen compared to the 25+GW of extra capacity in the province's regulated\nplanned reserve. This level is currently stable until about 2022. After\n2022, there will need to be investment or the reserve will drop below\nthe regulated amount. However, this needed new investment has already\nbeen mostly developed (or entirely depending on the model used) through\nthe refurbishment of nuclear.\n\n\nThe cancellation of the procurement will mean a slower increase in the\ngrowth of subsidized private electricity generation. CUPE's power\nworkers, Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been calling for the\ncancellation of new growth in subsidized power, albeit for slightly\ndifferent reasons.\n\n\nThe slow growth of storage capacity to deal with the increased solar and\nwind generation. We expect the upcoming (2017) Long-Term Energy Plan to\ndeal with this in some detail.\n\n\nThis cancellation does not affect projects already approved (see\nappendix) through the previous procurement process. The cancellation\nalso does not affect large mostly public projects like the Nanticoke\n44MW solar project (developed with SunEdison); OPG's partnership with\nthe Taykwa Tagamou Nation 25 MW Peter Sutherland Sr. Generating Station,\nlocated in Northeast Ontario; and \u200bOPG proposed expansion of Ranney\nFalls Generating Station in Northumberland County to 20MW.\n\n\nHydro Generation\n ~\n\n\nAbout a third of hydro generation companies in Ontario are run by\nprivate companies. H2O Power is one of the most aggressive in Northern\nOntario for smaller capacity. Others include TransAlta, Brookfield, and\nInnergex which have acquired older generation (or the companies that\nowned them).\n\n\nOntario Power Generation has most of the larger hydro capacity that is\ndeveloped in partnerships with First Nations. Further expansion of small\ngeneration capacity will be both OPG and these private energy companies.\nThese projects take a long time to develop and negotiate.",

In 2013,\nthe government cut the original project by \\$3.4B in 2013 leading to\nquestions about the stability of the Ontario government's green energy\nsubsidy programs. The project was completed in May 2015. In 2016,\nSamsung sold its stake the 270-megawatt project to Axium Infrastructure,\nAlberta Teachers' Retirement Fund and Manulife Financial Corp.  On September 27, the Ontario government cancelled it latest LRP. This\nround of LRP was for about 1GW of \"planned\" growth in solar, biomass and\nwind generation. This will not affect the growth of new private smaller\nscale developments that have access to public subsidies through the\nfee-in-tariffs (FIT) system. FIT is designed to support projects up to\n500 kilowatts with a subsidy for electricity provided back to the grid.\nThe cancellation happened after the period for open submissions the\nprocurement process ended, leading to the private sector denouncing the\ncancellation and the government for wasting their time and money.",

Right-wing governments started applying policies of\nasset recycling in the mid-1990s in Europe and India as a way to reform\nwelfare economies. Pension funds and other private finance capital funds\nare promoting for these kinds of partial privatizations as they push for\nsafe investment opportunities.\n\n\nAsset recycling is being sold as an easy way that governments can get\nmore money for investment in new capital projects without increasing\ntaxes by using financial tools used by private sector corporations. The\nprivate sector has access to many different financing mechanisms to take\non debt for investment in new capital. Those that promote asset\nrecycling are usually driven by these financial schemes in an effort to\nrelabel debt as something that does not appear as debt in budgets.\n\n\nAsset recycling requires the set-up of an investment pool or\ninfrastructure trust. These pools of money or capital are set aside from\nregular government budgets. They are borrowed against for funds for\nspecific capital projects. Governments can then invest in capital\nprojects which are to result in a financial return or savings for\ngovernment. These revenues or savings are then to help pay for the debt,\nmuch like how corporations in the private sector economy operate. As\nmoney comes back into the investment pool or capital projects are\nfinished, the investment pool is then borrowed against again -- or\nrecycled -- for other capital projects.\n\n\nIn theory, debt generated by asset recycling is paid-back through\nprivate sector partners finding efficiencies or increased government\nrevenue driven increased economic growth. However, unlike leveraging\nthat occurs in the private sector, governments who are engaging in asset\nrecycling are not investing in productive revenue generating capital\nprojects. Also, roads and other transport infrastructure cannot be\n\"recycled\" in the future, so investments like these are just a one-step\nprivatization process.\n\n\nIn practice, asset recycling is similar to other privatization schemes\n-- such as public-private partnerships -- that cost governments more\nmoney than traditional public debt financed investment. In addition,\nmanagement of public assets and services of government are based on\ndifferent models from commercial activities. For example, proponents of\nasset recycling state that efficiencies come from involving private\nsector expertise in reforming and modernizing public institutions.\nHowever, many studies have shown negligible levels of efficiencies are\nfound through involving the private sector in delivery of public\nservices, undermining asset recycling proponent's main source of revenue\nand benefit.\n\n\nWhen the Australian Senate gutted the Abbot Government's asset recycling\nbill, they simply re-titled the bill \"Encouraging Privatization\" to more\naccurately reflect what the bill amounted to. Australia had to bribe its\nstates and municipalities to engage in public asset recycling with a\nbonus of 15% in addition to the asset price. There is no benefit to the\npublic interest in paying to sell useful public assets for short-term\nbudget balancing.\n\n\nAreas that would be subject to Asset Recycling include:\n\n\n\n\nwater infrastructure\n\n\nwaste water infrastructure\n\n\nelectricity utilities\n\n\ntoll roads\n\n\nports\n\n\npublic office buildings\n\n\ncrown corporations\n\n\nliquor control board infrastructure\n\n\ndefence infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nMowat Report on Asset Recycling\n ~\n\n\nAsset recycling was first introduced to Ontario policy makers in Ontario\nseriously by the a Mowat Centre report entitled \"Recycling Ontario's\nAssets: A New Framework for Managing Public Finances.\"\n\n\nThe Mowat report stated one of the problems with the current asset\nmanagement arrangement is the \"lack of commercial expertise.\" Government\nexpertise in commercial knowledge is an obvious asset, but only if it is\nmodified to work in the interests of the public. Instead of\nprivatization, the government could invest in workers with asset\nmanagement skills that can be geared with the public interest in mind.\n\n\nThe other problems outlined in the study are either self-inflicted\nthrough budgeting ideology or what unions would not consider problems at\nall:\n\n\n\n\nlack of capital\n\n\ndifficult to raise private capital\n\n\nlack of long-term strategic plans\n\n\nbudget and tax rules (inhibiting privatization)\n\n\nnot knowing true value of an asset (on the private market)\n\n\npressure from stakeholders (such as union and general public)\n\n\nabsence of rigorous assessment frameworks (because of lack\n    of expertise)\n\n\nlimited areas allow investment by pension funds\n\n\n\n\nThe Mowat report focuses on Australia's example but excludes examples\nfrom the UK, Australia, Indonesia and India where partial privatizations\nhave not resulted in the promised benefits. Many of these other examples\nignored by the report show that asset sales are not guaranteed to\ngenerated the desired amount of capital, do not reduce risk to the\npublic sector and to not lead to the kind of efficiencies promised. In\nmany cases the level of inefficiency in government managed\ninfrastructure are overstated and returns much lower.\n\n\nThe Mowat report's reasons for acting now -- such as low interest rates\n-- are also reasons for the government to engage in more traditional and\ncheaper forms of borrowing. The report also highlights some of the\nreasons that corporations would be interested in buying or investing in\npublic assets including that many government utilities operate in as a\nmonopoly. So, while promoting asset recycling as a way to find\nefficiencies private sector involvement, Mowat is promoting asset\nrecycling to private companies by saying they would benefit from fewer,\nnot more, market forces constraining their profits. It is contradictory\nand incorrect to say that monopoly public monopolies cost consumers and\ntaxpayers more than private monopolies and that competition will drive\nefficiency in areas of natural monopoly such as energy utilities.\n\n\nFrom the Mowat report: \"The ability of a purchaser of a public asset to\nacquire a public monopoly (or an entity operating within a protected\nregime) further enhances the value of the asset (and the bid price).\"\n\n\nBC Asset Sales Example\n ~\n\n\nThe British Columbia Auditor General's 2014 report highlights how the BC\nLiberal Government balanced its books with a record breaking \\$601\nmillion sale of government assets.

In addition, with most\npartial asset sales, the future costs of maintenance and upgrades are\nstill on the public dime.\n\n\nAsset recycling is a similar to these asset sales in that it robs future\nbudgets to balance the current one and the government gives-up some\nability to generate revenue and regulate. The BC AG's report also\nhighlights how P3's (similar to asset recycling in its relationship to\nprivatization) have increased borrowing costs (interest rates) from 4%\nto 7.5%.
