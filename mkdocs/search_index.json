However, none of their problems are related to the public\nownership and control and none of these issues are solved through\nprivatization.\n\n\nPrivatization schemes detract from what the government should be focused\non: delivering affordable, high-quality service of reliable sustainable\nenergy to Ontarians.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Ontario has a long history of Progressive Conservative\nand Liberal governments toying with privatization schemes for the Hydro\nsystem. Ontario's electricity system was first undermined in the\nConservative Mike Harris years that fragmented a functioning, rational\nand regulated electricity system.\n\n\nCUPE was instrumental in stopping Harris from completing a privatization\nand marketization program that would have resulted in bringing-in an\nirrational and expensive private energy system to Ontario.\nUnfortunately, Harris did succeed in breaking-up parts of public system\nenough to cause a mess. Since then, successive Liberal governments have\npursued the ideological agenda of privatization and costly P3s that lead\nto the gas plant scandals.\n\n\nThis history of privatization and fragmentation of Hydro generation and\ntransmission has driven rates up and fragmented our electricity system.\n\n\nHistory and evidence from around the world shows that when governments\nfocus on delivery of service public power delivers.

In addition to this, reliable, affordable and\nplanned power can also determine the success or failure of local\neconomic development. Industries and services need to know how much\npower is going to cost and that it will be always there when they need\nit.\n\n\nWe do not believe that private profit and outside interests should come\nbetween electricity and the Ontarians.\n\n\nGreen Energy\n#\n\n\nIt is important to remember that our green energy future depends on\nelectric energy replacing many of fossil-fuel energy sources.\n\n\nHowever, this shift to green electrical energy must be managed with\npublic sector vision and regulation to happen fast enough and limit any\nunintended negative side-effects for workers and communities.\n\n\nThere are near 30,000 people employed in the Ontario electricity sector.\nThese are high-quality jobs in communities around the province. It is\nimportant for these communities that the transition to green energy is\nplanned in a way where costs do not fall disproportionately on workers\nand their communities. This means long-term plans that include\nmapping-out training and skills development, promoting environmentally\nsustainable consumption and ensuring communities have a say about\npriorities interacting with local concerns.\n\n\nLocal green initiatives must be coordinated with large scale generation\nso as to maintain balance in the electricity system. This kind of\nplanning and coordination across the province can only be done\nefficiently through public sector. This includes coordination between\nthe provincially owned utilities that provide generation, transmission\nand rural distribution with municipally owned distribution companies.\n\n\nDemocratic control is necessary for a just transition to green energy\ngeneration that is independent of fickle private energy markets.\n\n\nPublic or private ownership, the same problems remain\n#\n\n\n\n\nLarge Investment needed\n\n\nProcurement of technology\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Development of new technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological approach\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal perspective (7 Generations)\n\n\nPublic Good rather than private profit\n\n\nPublic Ownership and Bring back into public ownership\n\n\nOppose Fracking\n\n\nConservation\n\n\n\n\nPublic ownership solves these problems more easily:\n\n\n\n\nShort, medium and long-term planning possible\n\n\nLocal industrial procurement possible\n\n\nStable and smooth investment growth\n\n\nDriven by democracy/policy, not profit\n\n\nPublic Investment and ownership means all dollars go to\n    infrastructure\n\n\nPublic policy debate instead of corporate board debate.\n\n\nJust Transition easier.\n\n\nPublic research for new technologies.\n\n\nDirect public economic benefits\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives\n#\n\n\nCan Pension Funds play a role?\n\n\nYes, through public green infrastructure bonds by reducing debt burden\nwhile providing pension funds with stable investment.\n\n\nPromotion of this option can be done by ensuring public ownership and\ncontrol instead of through costly P3s and privatisation.",

As tuition fees go up and start\n    to represent the \"actual\" cost of education there is more of a\n    business relationship between the university services and\n    the student.\n\n\nThe result is a change in the nature of an education, less merit\n    based education. For example, the professor cannot fail someone in a\n    fully commodified education system since they have purchased\n    the degree.\n\n\nThe impact on non-academic services is that all services become\n    viewed through a commodity lens and this makes it easier to\n    privatize services. There is a loss of solidarity between the\n    students and the workers as students become consumers (owners)\n    instead of just accessing a service.\n\n\nAlso occurs at the course/discipline level.

Universities\n    are becoming less independent, less trustworthy, and less reliable\n    as they become more involved in business ventures.

Service or access\n    to assets become commodified when a price is applied to a previously\n    free or socialized good or service.  For PSE, raising tuition fees and breaking-out other fees as\n    \"ancillary\" commodifies education. As tuition fees go up and start\n    to represent the \"actual\" cost of education there is more of a\n    business relationship between the university services and\n    the student.  The result is a change in the nature of an education, less merit\n    based education. For example, the professor cannot fail someone in a\n    fully commodified education system since they have purchased\n    the degree.  The impact on non-academic services is that all services become\n    viewed through a commodity lens and this makes it easier to\n    privatize services. There is a loss of solidarity between the\n    students and the workers as students become consumers (owners)\n    instead of just accessing a service.  Also occurs at the course/discipline level. Whenever you hear about\n    the \"arts\" being under-valued, that is a form of commodification\n    of education.",

Universities\n    are becoming less independent, less trustworthy, and less reliable\n    as they become more involved in business ventures. Universities are\n    also at risk of becoming less inclined towards protecting public\n    interest over private interests as the financial costs of losing\n    industry partners becomes greater.
