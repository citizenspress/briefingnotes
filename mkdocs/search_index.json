The original GEA was supposed to foster investment in the Ontario production of wind and solar generators and technology that reduces energy demand such as LED light bulbs for traffic lights. The focus of the plan was to subsidize the growth in the percentage of and absolute amount of generation using solar/wind/biomass in Ontario's supply mix.\n\n\nInstead of supporting the growth of public electricity generation, the Ontario government's plan for electricity generation through solar, wind and biomass growth was to use feed-in tariffs and other subsidies to drive private investment.\n\n\nThe original Green Energy Act had a requirement that a percentage of all renewable products had to be manufactured in Ontario to get access to the public subsidy. However, this was challenged at the WTO, Ontario lost and had to remove this local procurement provision from the Act.\n\n\nThe government has also spurred investment of wind/solar/biomass generation through \"The Large Renewable Procurement\" (LRP), a competitive process for procuring large renewable energy projects generally larger than 500 kilowatts. This procurement process used subsidies, long-term price guarantees and direct financial support to drive private investment.\n\n\nOntario now has about 4,000 MW of installed wind capacity and 2,000 of solar power capacity.\n\n\nOne of these larger wind procurement deals was the 20-year power purchase agreement with Samsung which includes 140 turbines. In 2013, the government cut the original project by $3.4B in 2013 leading to questions about the stability of the Ontario government's green energy subsidy programs. The project was completed in May 2015. In 2016, Samsung sold its stake the 270-megawatt project to Axium Infrastructure, Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund and Manulife Financial Corp.\n\n\nOn September 27, the Ontario government cancelled it latest LRP. This round of LRP was for about 1GW of \"planned\" growth in solar, biomass and wind generation. This will not affect the growth of new private smaller scale developments that have access to public subsidies through the fee-in-tariffs (FIT) system. FIT is designed to support projects up to 500 kilowatts with a subsidy for electricity provided back to the grid. The cancellation happened after the period for open submissions the procurement process ended, leading to the private sector denouncing the cancellation and the government for wasting their time and money.\n\n\nAnalysis\n ~\n\n\nThe cancellation of 1GW of new private renewable generation is small when compared to the 25+GW of extra capacity in the province's regulated planned reserve. This level is currently stable until about 2022. After 2022, there will need to be investment or the reserve will drop below the regulated amount. However, this needed new investment has already been mostly developed (or entirely depending on the model used) through the refurbishment of nuclear.\n\n\nThe cancellation of the procurement will mean a slower increase in the growth of subsidized private electricity generation. CUPE's power workers, Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been calling for the cancellation of new growth in subsidized power, albeit for slightly different reasons.\n\n\nThe slow growth of storage capacity to deal with the increased solar and wind generation. We expect the upcoming (2017) Long-Term Energy Plan to deal with this in some detail.\n\n\nThis cancellation does not affect projects already approved (see appendix) through the previous procurement process. The cancellation also does not affect large mostly public projects like the Nanticoke 44MW solar project (developed with SunEdison); OPG's partnership with the Taykwa Tagamou Nation 25 MW Peter Sutherland Sr. Generating Station, located in Northeast Ontario; and \u200bOPG proposed expansion of Ranney Falls Generating Station in Northumberland County to 20MW.\n\n\nHydro Generation\n ~\n\n\nAbout a third of hydro generation companies in Ontario are run by private companies. H2O Power is one of the most aggressive in Northern Ontario for smaller capacity. Others include TransAlta, Brookfield, and Innergex which have acquired older generation (or the companies that owned them).\n\n\nOntario Power Generation has most of the larger hydro capacity that is developed in partnerships with First Nations. Further expansion of small generation capacity will be both OPG and these private energy companies. These projects take a long time to develop and negotiate.",

FIT is designed to support projects up to 500 kilowatts with a subsidy for electricity provided back to the grid. The cancellation happened after the period for open submissions the procurement process ended, leading to the private sector denouncing the cancellation and the government for wasting their time and money.",

This level is currently stable until about 2022. After 2022, there will need to be investment or the reserve will drop below the regulated amount. However, this needed new investment has already been mostly developed (or entirely depending on the model used) through the refurbishment of nuclear.  The cancellation of the procurement will mean a slower increase in the growth of subsidized private electricity generation. CUPE's power workers, Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been calling for the cancellation of new growth in subsidized power, albeit for slightly different reasons.  The slow growth of storage capacity to deal with the increased solar and wind generation. We expect the upcoming (2017) Long-Term Energy Plan to deal with this in some detail.  This cancellation does not affect projects already approved (see appendix) through the previous procurement process. The cancellation also does not affect large mostly public projects like the Nanticoke 44MW solar project (developed with SunEdison); OPG's partnership with the Taykwa Tagamou Nation 25 MW Peter Sutherland Sr. Generating Station, located in Northeast Ontario; and \u200bOPG proposed expansion of Ranney Falls Generating Station in Northumberland County to 20MW.",

Asset Recycling comes in various forms and can include or\nbe known as:\n\n\n\n\nPartial privatization\n\n\nMonetizing public assets\n\n\n(Partial) Disinvestment\n\n\nRe-mortgaging\n\n\nLeveraging\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of \"recycling\" value from owned assets comes from the\nfinancial sector in the 1980s as companies looked for new debt-driven\ninvestment schemes. Right-wing governments started applying policies of\nasset recycling in the mid-1990s in Europe and India as a way to reform\nwelfare economies. Pension funds and other private finance capital funds\nare promoting for these kinds of partial privatizations as they push for\nsafe investment opportunities.\n\n\nAsset recycling is being sold as an easy way that governments can get\nmore money for investment in new capital projects without increasing\ntaxes by using financial tools used by private sector corporations. The\nprivate sector has access to many different financing mechanisms to take\non debt for investment in new capital. Those that promote asset\nrecycling are usually driven by these financial schemes in an effort to\nrelabel debt as something that does not appear as debt in budgets.\n\n\nAsset recycling requires the set-up of an investment pool or\ninfrastructure trust. These pools of money or capital are set aside from\nregular government budgets. They are borrowed against for funds for\nspecific capital projects. Governments can then invest in capital\nprojects which are to result in a financial return or savings for\ngovernment. These revenues or savings are then to help pay for the debt,\nmuch like how corporations in the private sector economy operate. As\nmoney comes back into the investment pool or capital projects are\nfinished, the investment pool is then borrowed against again -- or\nrecycled -- for other capital projects.\n\n\nIn theory, debt generated by asset recycling is paid-back through\nprivate sector partners finding efficiencies or increased government\nrevenue driven increased economic growth. However, unlike leveraging\nthat occurs in the private sector, governments who are engaging in asset\nrecycling are not investing in productive revenue generating capital\nprojects. Also, roads and other transport infrastructure cannot be\n\"recycled\" in the future, so investments like these are just a one-step\nprivatization process.\n\n\nIn practice, asset recycling is similar to other privatization schemes\n-- such as public-private partnerships -- that cost governments more\nmoney than traditional public debt financed investment. In addition,\nmanagement of public assets and services of government are based on\ndifferent models from commercial activities. For example, proponents of\nasset recycling state that efficiencies come from involving private\nsector expertise in reforming and modernizing public institutions.\nHowever, many studies have shown negligible levels of efficiencies are\nfound through involving the private sector in delivery of public\nservices, undermining asset recycling proponent's main source of revenue\nand benefit.\n\n\nWhen the Australian Senate gutted the Abbot Government's asset recycling\nbill, they simply re-titled the bill \"Encouraging Privatization\" to more\naccurately reflect what the bill amounted to. Australia had to bribe its\nstates and municipalities to engage in public asset recycling with a\nbonus of 15% in addition to the asset price. There is no benefit to the\npublic interest in paying to sell useful public assets for short-term\nbudget balancing.\n\n\nAreas that would be subject to Asset Recycling include:\n\n\n\n\nwater infrastructure\n\n\nwaste water infrastructure\n\n\nelectricity utilities\n\n\ntoll roads\n\n\nports\n\n\npublic office buildings\n\n\ncrown corporations\n\n\nliquor control board infrastructure\n\n\ndefence infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nMowat Report on Asset Recycling\n ~\n\n\nAsset recycling was first introduced to Ontario policy makers in Ontario\nseriously by the a Mowat Centre report entitled \"Recycling Ontario's\nAssets: A New Framework for Managing Public Finances.\"\n\n\nThe Mowat report stated one of the problems with the current asset\nmanagement arrangement is the \"lack of commercial expertise.\" Government\nexpertise in commercial knowledge is an obvious asset, but only if it is\nmodified to work in the interests of the public. Instead of\nprivatization, the government could invest in workers with asset\nmanagement skills that can be geared with the public interest in mind.\n\n\nThe other problems outlined in the study are either self-inflicted\nthrough budgeting ideology or what unions would not consider problems at\nall:\n\n\n\n\nlack of capital\n\n\ndifficult to raise private capital\n\n\nlack of long-term strategic plans\n\n\nbudget and tax rules (inhibiting privatization)\n\n\nnot knowing true value of an asset (on the private market)\n\n\npressure from stakeholders (such as union and general public)\n\n\nabsence of rigorous assessment frameworks (because of lack\n    of expertise)\n\n\nlimited areas allow investment by pension funds\n\n\n\n\nThe Mowat report focuses on Australia's example but excludes examples\nfrom the UK, Australia, Indonesia and India where partial privatizations\nhave not resulted in the promised benefits. Many of these other examples\nignored by the report show that asset sales are not guaranteed to\ngenerated the desired amount of capital, do not reduce risk to the\npublic sector and to not lead to the kind of efficiencies promised. In\nmany cases the level of inefficiency in government managed\ninfrastructure are overstated and returns much lower.\n\n\nThe Mowat report's reasons for acting now -- such as low interest rates\n-- are also reasons for the government to engage in more traditional and\ncheaper forms of borrowing. The report also highlights some of the\nreasons that corporations would be interested in buying or investing in\npublic assets including that many government utilities operate in as a\nmonopoly. So, while promoting asset recycling as a way to find\nefficiencies private sector involvement, Mowat is promoting asset\nrecycling to private companies by saying they would benefit from fewer,\nnot more, market forces constraining their profits. It is contradictory\nand incorrect to say that monopoly public monopolies cost consumers and\ntaxpayers more than private monopolies and that competition will drive\nefficiency in areas of natural monopoly such as energy utilities.\n\n\nFrom the Mowat report: \"The ability of a purchaser of a public asset to\nacquire a public monopoly (or an entity operating within a protected\nregime) further enhances the value of the asset (and the bid price).\"\n\n\nBC Asset Sales Example\n ~\n\n\nThe British Columbia Auditor General's 2014 report highlights how the BC\nLiberal Government balanced its books with a record breaking \\$601\nmillion sale of government assets.

The BC AG's report also\nhighlights how P3's (similar to asset recycling in its relationship to\nprivatization) have increased borrowing costs (interest rates) from 4%\nto 7.5%.
