<p>Electricity generation in Ontario is provided through a mix of Nuclear,
Hydro, natural gas, reserve and solar/wind/biomass generation.</p>
<p><img alt="Installed generation capacity in Ontario
(2015)" src="../Downloads/Ontario-supply.png" title="supply" /></p>
<p><img alt="Actual generation used in Ontario (160TWh total
2015)" src="../Downloads/Ontario-Generation.png" title="generation" /></p>
<p>The previous long-term energy plan for the province was twinned with the
Green Energy Act (GEA). The original GEA was supposed to foster
investment in the Ontario production of wind and solar generators and
technology that reduces energy demand such as LED light bulbs for
traffic lights. The focus of the plan was to subsidize the growth in the
percentage of and absolute amount of generation using solar/wind/biomass
in Ontario's supply mix.</p>
<p>Instead of supporting the growth of public electricity generation, the
Ontario government's plan for electricity generation through solar, wind
and biomass growth was to use feed-in tariffs and other subsidies to
drive private investment.</p>
<p>The original Green Energy Act had a requirement that a percentage of all
renewable products had to be manufactured in Ontario to get access to
the public subsidy. However, this was challenged at the WTO, Ontario
lost and had to remove this local procurement provision from the Act.</p>
<p>The government has also spurred investment of wind/solar/biomass
generation through "The Large Renewable Procurement" (LRP), a
competitive process for procuring large renewable energy projects
generally larger than 500 kilowatts. This procurement process used
subsidies, long-term price guarantees and direct financial support to
drive private investment.</p>
<p>Ontario now has about 4,000 MW of installed wind capacity and 2,000 of
solar power capacity.</p>
<p>One of these larger wind procurement deals was the 20-year power
purchase agreement with Samsung which includes 140 turbines. In 2013,
the government cut the original project by \$3.4B in 2013 leading to
questions about the stability of the Ontario government's green energy
subsidy programs. The project was completed in May 2015. In 2016,
Samsung sold its stake the 270-megawatt project to Axium Infrastructure,
Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund and Manulife Financial Corp.</p>
<p>On September 27, the Ontario government cancelled it latest LRP. This
round of LRP was for about 1GW of "planned" growth in solar, biomass and
wind generation. This will not affect the growth of new private smaller
scale developments that have access to public subsidies through the
fee-in-tariffs (FIT) system. FIT is designed to support projects up to
500 kilowatts with a subsidy for electricity provided back to the grid.
The cancellation happened after the period for open submissions the
procurement process ended, leading to the private sector denouncing the
cancellation and the government for wasting their time and money.</p>
<h1 id="analysis">Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h1>
<p>The cancellation of 1GW of new private renewable generation is small
when compared to the 25+GW of extra capacity in the province's regulated
planned reserve. This level is currently stable until about 2022. After
2022, there will need to be investment or the reserve will drop below
the regulated amount. However, this needed new investment has already
been mostly developed (or entirely depending on the model used) through
the refurbishment of nuclear.</p>
<p>The cancellation of the procurement will mean a slower increase in the
growth of subsidized private electricity generation. CUPE's power
workers, Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been calling for the
cancellation of new growth in subsidized power, albeit for slightly
different reasons.</p>
<p>The slow growth of storage capacity to deal with the increased solar and
wind generation. We expect the upcoming (2017) Long-Term Energy Plan to
deal with this in some detail.</p>
<p>This cancellation does not affect projects already approved (see
appendix) through the previous procurement process. The cancellation
also does not affect large mostly public projects like the Nanticoke
44MW solar project (developed with SunEdison); OPG's partnership with
the Taykwa Tagamou Nation 25 MW Peter Sutherland Sr. Generating Station,
located in Northeast Ontario; and â€‹OPG proposed expansion of Ranney
Falls Generating Station in Northumberland County to 20MW.</p>
<h2 id="hydro-generation">Hydro Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#hydro-generation" title="Permanent link"> ~</a></h2>
<p>About a third of hydro generation companies in Ontario are run by
private companies. H2O Power is one of the most aggressive in Northern
Ontario for smaller capacity. Others include TransAlta, Brookfield, and
Innergex which have acquired older generation (or the companies that
owned them).</p>
<p>Ontario Power Generation has most of the larger hydro capacity that is
developed in partnerships with First Nations. Further expansion of small
generation capacity will be both OPG and these private energy companies.
These projects take a long time to develop and negotiate.</p></div>
