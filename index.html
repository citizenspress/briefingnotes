keeping quality union jobs in the sector?</p>
<p>This way you can also include Just Transition processes in the

<p>CUPE believe energy is a human right. Only through public ownership,
operation and control of all electrical energy production, transmission
and distribution Ontario can implement a long-term vision of transition
to zero carbon electricity. CUPE opposes costly privatization schemes.</p>
<p>Privatization will undermine the move to sustainable low-carbon
electricity production.</p>
<p>Privatization creates more problems than it tries to solve.</p>
<p>Privatization hurts communities, limits regulatory oversight and
undermines democratic control.</p>
<p>Like other electrical utilities around the world, Ontario's are not
perfect. However, none of their problems are related to the public
ownership and control and none of these issues are solved through
privatization.</p>
<p>Privatization schemes detract from what the government should be focused
on: delivering affordable, high-quality service of reliable sustainable
energy to Ontarians.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ontario has a long history of Progressive Conservative
and Liberal governments toying with privatization schemes for the Hydro
system. Ontario's electricity system was first undermined in the
Conservative Mike Harris years that fragmented a functioning, rational
and regulated electricity system.</p>
<p>CUPE was instrumental in stopping Harris from completing a privatization
and marketization program that would have resulted in bringing-in an
irrational and expensive private energy system to Ontario.
Unfortunately, Harris did succeed in breaking-up parts of public system
enough to cause a mess. Since then, successive Liberal governments have
pursued the ideological agenda of privatization and costly P3s that lead
to the gas plant scandals.</p>
<p>This history of privatization and fragmentation of Hydro generation and
transmission has driven rates up and fragmented our electricity system.</p>
<p>History and evidence from around the world shows that when governments
focus on delivery of service public power delivers. In crisis times such
as ice storms, floods or large snow falls it is the public power workers
that are able to respond and restore power.</p>
<p>CUPE has a vision for public power that is focused on providing
high-quality, affordable and sustainable power to the province of
Ontario. We believe that means energy should be thoughtfully planned and
produced from low-carbon sources and delivered in a way that respects
the rights of First People’s communities from the planning stage.</p>
<h2 id="energy-is-a-human-right">Energy is a human right<a class="headerlink" href="#energy-is-a-human-right" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Weather in Canada means access to electricity can mean the difference
between life and death. In addition to this, reliable, affordable and
planned power can also determine the success or failure of local
economic development. Industries and services need to know how much
power is going to cost and that it will be always there when they need
it.</p>
<p>We do not believe that private profit and outside interests should come
between electricity and the Ontarians.</p>
<h2 id="green-energy">Green Energy<a class="headerlink" href="#green-energy" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>It is important to remember that our green energy future depends on
electric energy replacing many of fossil-fuel energy sources.</p>
<p>However, this shift to green electrical energy must be managed with
public sector vision and regulation to happen fast enough and limit any
unintended negative side-effects for workers and communities.</p>
<p>There are near 30,000 people employed in the Ontario electricity sector.
These are high-quality jobs in communities around the province. It is
important for these communities that the transition to green energy is
planned in a way where costs do not fall disproportionately on workers
and their communities. This means long-term plans that include
mapping-out training and skills development, promoting environmentally
sustainable consumption and ensuring communities have a say about
priorities interacting with local concerns.</p>
<p>Local green initiatives must be coordinated with large scale generation
so as to maintain balance in the electricity system. This kind of
planning and coordination across the province can only be done
efficiently through public sector. This includes coordination between
the provincially owned utilities that provide generation, transmission
and rural distribution with municipally owned distribution companies.</p>
<p>Democratic control is necessary for a just transition to green energy
generation that is independent of fickle private energy markets.</p>
